    "# Rotman MMA Datathon: Instacart Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "Over the years, the demand for grocery deliveries and pick-ups services in Canada have been gradually increasing with platforms such as Instacart becoming more popular among customers. However, unlike food delivery services, Instacart shoppers do not always have the most updated information regarding whether a particular grocery item is available at large chain supermarkets. In addition, Instacart shoppers also have to spend more time figuring out where requested items are located in various supermarkets which increases the waiting time for customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to resolve both customers' and Instacart personal shoppers' pain point of figuring out whether an item is available or not, an 'Instabasket' aisle is introduced. This customized 'Instabasket' aisle is a one-stop destination with 1,000 products available for Instacart customers. With the Instabasket aisle, Instacart personal shoppers won't need to spend too much time searching for items in different aisles. If an item requested is not available, customers may have an option to substitute the requested item with another item in the Instabasket aisle. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement \n",
    "As mentioned before, the Instabasket aisle will serve as a one-stop destination for Instacart personal shoppers. To ensure that the Instabasket aisle is as effective as it can be in satisfying Instacart customers' demands, the products selected in this aisle must have high demands and can be a good substitute for a large number of products. While the total limit for the number of products in this aisle is 1,000 products, there is 100 spaces for refridgerated items and 100 spaces for frozen items available within these 1000 slots. Thereby, the aim of this project is to identify a list of 1,000 products that can optimize the Instabasket aisle's goal of fulfilling as many orders as possible. "

    "Firstly, I will explore the large range of products provided by the dataset. An initial count of unique Product ID shows that there is a total of 35,070 products in the dataset. These products have 2 levels of categorization. Firstly they are categorized from the top down into 21 departments where each department has aisles where the products are grouped into. There is a total of 154 aisles mentioned in the dataset. Apparently, the naming of the departments is similar to the department names that we often observe in supermarkets (i.e. Alcohol, Dairy, Produce, Beverages, etc.). This existing product categorization into departments is based on characteristics of the products regarding their shelf life, storage conditions, functionality and targeted users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon further inspections of each product names, I figured out that there are many products which have similar names. For instance, while 'Bag of Bananas', 'Bananas', and 'Banana' are labelled as different products, they are fundamentally the same item. Thus, I will study the names of the products in this part with the aim of grouping similar items together in order to narrow down the list of items to select from. "

A few assumptions will be made regarding the products' labels: \n",
    "1. The product's chosen stem word will be the stem word with the highest occuring frequency within the product's departments then aisle. As the aim of the stem word is to categorize items from different departments or aisle which may share some similarities regarding their content (i.e. frozen strawberries from the frozen department and organic strawberries from the produce department are both made out of strawberries), the stem word will be heavily determined by the word's popularity within the dataset to avoid choosing a specific stem word that refer to a highly specific item (i.e. tortilla). \n",
